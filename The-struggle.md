## The Struggle of Breaking into Cybersecurity

Getting into cybersecurity is incredibly hard. Not because the concepts themselves are impossible to learn, but because finding places that actually provide hands-on training is a real challenge. Compared to other trades and fields, it feels tedious and requires so much effort just to begin training yourself—unless you're willing to spend large amounts of money on courses and labs that lend you the experience.

I want to become a SOC Analyst. That is my goal. My dream job right now is to work in a SOC, analyzing alerts, investigating security incidents, and defending networks from cyber threats. But gaining real-world experience often feels like an impossible task. It seems like the only way to even get started is to essentially build your own SOC from scratch—set up a home lab, generate mock traffic, create mock alerts, and design an entire cybersecurity environment just to practice. That is a massive load to put on someone new to the field.

The jump from learning entry-level concepts to suddenly having to build full-scale cyber environments is overwhelming. At this point, I'd even be willing to work for free—shadowing, learning, and assisting with SOC Level 1 duties—just to get hands-on exposure. But even entry-level jobs and internships are asking for years of experience for roles that are, by definition, meant for beginners.

### My Daily Grind

Right now, my days are packed. I wake up, take my kids to school, complete my Google cybersecurity certificate courses, work on LetsDefend training, finish my university coursework for my bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, pick up my kids, and then head to work. During work, I’m constantly listening to podcasts, YouTube videos, and audiobooks about IT, cybersecurity, and career roadmaps—anything to keep learning and staying engaged.

Online, there's a lot of romanticizing around "I did this in 6 weeks and got a job" success stories. But for many of us, we're juggling multiple training courses, projects, schoolwork, and relentless job applications, only to receive another "We're sorry to inform you..." rejection email. It’s frustrating. Seeing people claim they landed a cybersecurity job overnight while you're grinding day and night can be disheartening.

### The Reality of Rejection and Imposter Syndrome

The constant rejection gets tough. It’s hard to stay motivated when every application feels like another shot in the dark. Imposter syndrome creeps in all the time. I question whether I know enough, whether I’m smart enough to understand these complex security systems, whether I’ll ever truly break into the field. But I remind myself: every lab, every training, every certification is one step closer.

### Still Chasing the Dream

Even though it feels out of reach, I’m not giving up. I’m only in my second year of university, and there’s still so much to learn and experience. But I’ll keep grinding, keep applying, keep training—because at the end of the day, my goal remains the same. I will become a SOC Analyst.
